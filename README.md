# PowerBi_bank_data_project
Here you will find a Power BI project based on banking data sourced from Kaggle

First, I organized the data by separating it into different tables and creating a data model. Using Power Query, I calculated additional metrics such as ROA, ROE, and Liquidity. With DAX formulas, I computed the loan-to-deposit ratio and the weighted percentage of non-performing loans.


Summary of Power BI Project
This Power BI project is designed to provide a comprehensive analysis of banking data, showcasing key financial metrics and trends. The report is divided into two pages, each with distinct visualizations and insights:

Page 1: Key Metrics
This page focuses on high-level performance indicators and trends, providing an overview of the bank's financial position over time. Key features include:

Trend Analysis:
A visual representation of how Total Assets, Total Deposits, and Total Loans have changed over time, enabling users to track growth and identify trends.

Key Financial Indicators:
Cards displaying essential financial metrics:
Return on Equity (ROE): Measures the bank's profitability in relation to shareholders' equity.
Return on Assets (ROA): Reflects the efficiency in generating returns from the bank's total assets.
Liquidity: Highlights the bank's ability to meet short-term obligations.
Weighted Percentage of Non-Performing Loans: An important indicator of asset quality.

Filters:
Year and Quarter slicers allow users to narrow the analysis to specific time periods for more granular insights.

Page 2: Loans and Deposits Trends
This page provides a detailed exploration of trends related to loans and deposits, offering visualizations that enhance understanding of the bank's operational dynamics:

Scatter Plot:
A visualization comparing Total Deposits and Total Loans by year, showing the relationship between the two metrics over time.

Bar Chart:
Displays the total loans and Non-Performing Loans (NPLs) by year, providing a clear view of the proportion of underperforming loans within the overall loan portfolio.

Gauge Visualization:
Depicts the Loan-to-Deposit Ratio for the most recent quarter, giving a snapshot of the bank's lending efficiency and stability.
